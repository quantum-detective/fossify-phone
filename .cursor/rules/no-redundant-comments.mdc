# No Redundant Comments

When generating or editing code:

- **Do not add inline comments** unless they explain non-obvious behavior, workarounds, or important constraints.
- **Do not comment straightforward code** (e.g., obvious variable names, simple conditionals, standard patterns). The code should be self-explanatory.
- Prefer clear naming and structure over comments. If a comment is needed to explain what code does, consider refactoring instead.

Add comments only when they add real value: non-obvious logic, business rules, security/correctness notes, or references to external specs.
